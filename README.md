It is happening now: when you open a new web page through your phone or laptop, your information is recorded in cookies. It does help when the website remembers what your preferences are so that you donâ€™t need to input next time. But the main purpose of getting your cookies is to know who you are for commercial use. Information such as what your browsers are, what your regions are, or how much time you spend on a page, etc will be revealed when you agreed with the cookie policy (the annoying window asking for your agreement to collect your information each time when you enter a new website that never been before).

Ideally, if this system can be dynamic in real time, it will be perfect. But I am interested to test this concept through my own justification.
